# Kivy Template

A blank Kivy project. You can use these code files as a template for create a new screen.

* think of a name for your page
* rename mypagename.kv to your new name
 * this file should be all in lower case and contain no spaces
* rename MyPageName in the main.py and the .kv file
 * you may use mixed case here to separate words

## Example

I want to create a new title page, so I choose the name `Title`.
First I rename `mypagename.kv` to `title.kv`. Then in my editor (you can use Spyder for this) I change `MyPageName` to `Title` everywhere in the `.py` file and `.kv` file.
